String class
	String s;
	s = new String("hello");
	etc...

	String - reference and object

StringBuffer class
	almost a string
		sb = "hello";	//illegal
		sb = new StringBuffer("hello");
		
		sb.append("bye");	//hellobye
		concatenation modifies the original object
		s = s + "bye"		//hellobye
		concatenation creates a new object with the concatenated string
	makes operations a lot easier than in String

Math class
	abs()		absolute value
	
	ceil(double x)	smallest whole number >= x
	
	floor(double x)	largest whole number <= x
	round(double x)	x rounded up to long

Random class
	constructors: (when you call methods from this class, you don't have to give it a seed)
		public Random()
			uses time of day as seed
		public Random(long s)
			uses s as seed
	public boolean nextBoolean()
	public double nextDouble()
	public float nextFloat()
	public int nextInt()
	public int nextInt(int n)
	public long nextLong()
	public void setSeed(long s)
